because i dont like [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) or [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) but i like [python](https://www.python.org/), [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [latex.css](https://latex.now.sh/)

goals:
- [x] add config.json instead of editing source variables.
- [x] find file extensions/paths better. this could be fixed by just adding .md to the url. it is not exactly what i wanted but it will probably get the job done.
- [ ] find a better way to serve files according to routes. i just realized that it is trying to request pass my favico to pandoc and that's not good.
- [ ] find a way to put things in separate folders and still be able to use them.
- [ ] add live reload
